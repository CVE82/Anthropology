  bio: "I received my B.Sc. in geological sciences and archaeology from Leeds University in England in 1980, my M.A. in 1982, and my Ph.D. in 1987 in archaeology from the University of California, Los Angeles. I taught on the faculty of Louisiana State University from 1990 to 2007, becoming Professor and Chair of the Department of Geography and Anthropology. Most recently, I was a project director for William Self Associates, Inc., located in the San Francisco Bay area, and a research affiliate of the Archaeological Research Facility at the University of California, Berkeley. I am a historical archaeologist whose research interests have focused upon how colonial systems impact the lives and cultures of indigenous and enslaved peoples and their descendants. I am particularly interested in how people maintain, modify, and adapt their identities under a variety of situations created by contact with groups of people with different identities. Historical archaeology is a discipline that blends the fields of history, historical anthropology, and archaeology, and is interdisciplinary by its very nature. It is well suited to studying and seeking to understand complex issues of changing identities over time. I have spent the last 30 years studying British, Spanish, and French colonial systems in the New World, with a particular focus on the experiences of colonized and subaltern populations. My research has included archaeological excavations in the Caribbean, Louisiana, and the West (primarily California). My primary research area has been the late-18th to early-19th century Bahamas. My research is primarily concerned with the experiences of the African-Bahamian population. The African-Bahamian population of this colony was composed of American-born, Bahamian-born and African-born persons. African-American culture in the Bahamas reflects the influence of many of the elements that shaped African-American cultures of the U.S. South, but in a West Indian geographic, environmental, political, and economic setting, resulting in a unique Bahamian identity that has elements derived from each region. My research, using archaeological evidence in conjunction with demographic analysis, has demonstrated that enslaved Africans maintained distinct ethnic identities in the Bahamas, but simultaneously created pan-African identities. My research in Louisiana included extensive work on both members of the planter class as well as enslaved and freed African populations. Again, as in the Bahamas, my research was focused on understanding cultural pluralities and the dynamics of cultural change in colonial and subsequent American contexts. My Louisiana research included colonial and American period populations and society. Another major focus of my research has been the economic and social contexts of Native American cultural change in the Franciscan missions of Alta California based on my research at Mission Soledad in the Salinas Valley of California. More recently, I researched archaeological sites of the second half of the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries in the West. I studied such sites in California, Arizona, Utah, and, to a lesser degree, Texas and Nevada. This research took place in a cultural resource management context. The rise of consumerism, as well as the commercialization of medicine, is also of considerable interest to me, as is the maintenance and reinterpretation of identity through the mid-late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. One recent project focused on the experiences of Irish immigrants in the second half of the nineteenth century in San Francisco. In addition, as a result of working in cultural resource management for a number of years, I am interested in the ways that state and federal cultural-resource and historic-preservation laws, regulations, and guidelines are interpreted and implemented. In particular, I am interested in the differences between traditional archaeological practice and ethics, and federal and state agency interpretations of laws, regulations, and guidelines that restrict archaeological practice in ways that appear to conflict with traditional archaeological ethics."

  expertise: "Linguistic anthropology, Language socialization, Immigrant communities, Language and culture in educational contexts, Language and social inequality, Narrative, Europe and North Africa"
  bio: "I am a linguistic anthropologist with a strong interdisciplinary training in anthropology, linguistics, and education. My work examines immigrant children and youth's communicative practices, broadly conceived, in the contexts of educational institutions (both secular and religious), peer groups, and families, and across linguistic, cultural, and national boundaries.  My research agenda combines long-term ethnography and fine-grained discourse analysis of language use (in both interviews and everyday practices), along with archival and print material. This approach allows me to contextualize everyday linguistic and sociocultural practices within a larger sociohistorical frame. My research agenda offers a critical dialogue between linguistic anthropology, educational ethnography, and socio-cultural development of bi-/multilingual immigrant children and youth. My book entitled Language and Muslim Immigrant Childhoods: The Politics of Belonging (2014) is rooted in two years of ethnographic field study in southwestern Spain and Morocco.  The project examines how Moroccan immigrant children in Spain navigate the local and national politics of inclusion and exclusion in the wake of increased levels of surveillance directed toward Muslim and North African immigrants. Moroccan immigrant children walk a tightrope between difference and belonging as they simultaneously participate in their own immigrant community and in a \"host\" society deeply ambivalent about cultural change and the multicultural politics of \"belonging\" provoked by recent migratory trends. In contemporary Spain, this ambivalence resonates forcefully in the current geopolitical climate of suspicion surrounding Muslim and North African immigrants, who also embody the enduring historical residue of cultural representations of the Moor invaders of centuries past.  In light of this marginalization of Moroccan immigrants, whereby anxieties and historical resonances are conflated with issues of security and fears of religious fanaticism and terrorism, this book examines Moroccan immigrant children's everyday social engagements in and out of school with broader sociopolitical discourses implicated in establishing belonging or experiencing difference in their multiple communities.  Throughout this book, my approach focuses on the emergent qualities of immigrant children's everyday social interaction in relation to the dynamic and processual qualities of group formation, identification, and socialization.  This book project has implications for broader debates regarding immigrant youths' social and cultural welfare, and for efforts to address educational alienation among Muslim immigrant youth in Europe. My book project also contributes to the growing literature on the constitutive role of language and everyday interactions in the production of exclusion and inequality in social contexts of marginalization, particularly in relation to cultural, linguistic, and ethnic minority students. My most immediate research project considers how Moroccan immigrant children's language practices shape literacy processes in linguistic minority contexts.  In this project, I examine the linguistic repertoires displayed by these children in informal and formal learning contexts in order to identify commonalities in discursive practices across formal and informal learning contexts.  Bringing together a rich tradition of studies of literacy within linguistic anthropology and recent cultural-modeling research in immigrant and minority contexts, I focus on the generative points of continuity between, on one hand, the linguistic skills and literacy strategies involved in immigrant children's everyday communicative practices with family and peers and, on the other hand, the skills and strategies that are sanctioned by educational institutions, particularly in the Spanish Literacy Enhancement classes they have to attend. This project offers an original perspective on literacy processes among immigrant and minority children in that most studies done to date have emphasized home–school dichotomies rather than connections. Another current research endeavor brings together the stories of personal experiences of Moroccan immigrant children in Spain and Latino immigrant youth in the U.S.  In this comparative project, I highlight these children and youth’s own perspectives and understandings of their lived experience in relation to larger ideologies and discourses that have a long tradition of framing them as problems (e.g. an integration problem, an educational problem, a delinquency problem, a teen-pregnancy problem…etc).  In this project, I capitalize on immigrant children and youth's abilities to analyze their own social worlds and to reflect upon their lived experience in relation to the sociopolitical worlds and realities they occupy. This project will allow me to speak to the similarities and differences in the issues affecting immigrant linguistic minorities cross-culturally."

  bio: "I am a linguistic anthropologist whose research and teaching specializations include creole languages and cultures, particularly those of the Caribbean region; language socialization; ideologies of language; the sociocultural dynamics of language contact; and the political economy of language and communicative practice. Among my other interests are interspecies communication, particularly between humans and wildlife; and the historical, political, and ideological dimensions of transgressive language (such as cursing, swearing, insults, slurs, gaffes, libel, blasphemy, \"hate speech,\" etc.). I joined the Department of Anthropology at Temple in 2001. Before that, I was on the faculty of the Human Development Program at California State University, Long Beach, where I also had affiliations with the Departments of Anthropology and Linguistics. I earned my bachelor’s degree in sociology (with a concentration in African Studies) at Yale University, and my master’s and doctoral degrees in anthropology at New York University. Much of my work in recent years has been editorial work: since 2011, I have been the Associate Editor of the Journal of Linguistic Anthropology (of which three issues are published per year), and I am also one of four members of the editorial board of the book series Oxford Studies in the Anthropology of Language. In my current field research, I examine interactions between humans and non-humans—more specifically, between urban/suburban-dwelling humans and local wildlife, ranging from juvenile songbirds to adult deer and coyotes. I am particularly interested in how people respond to inadvertent and unexpected encounters with wildlife. In past years, my research focused on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia, where an Afro-French creole language known as Kwéyòl is spoken along with local vernacular varieties of English. Much of my work deals with ongoing processes of language change and language shift, examining the historical conditions that have given rise to these processes and the sociocultural, politico-economic, and ideological factors that continue to shape them. Drawing on a large corpus of naturalistic audio-video recordings as well as historical, textual, and other forms of evidence, I examine various ways in which St. Lucians’ everyday communicative practices, particularly socializing interactions between young children and their caregivers, are having far-reaching (but largely unforeseen and misrecognized) ramifications."

  bio: "Over the past several years my interests have shifted from paleoanthropology and primatology to natural philosophy which includes inputs from functional (molecular) biology and the epistemology of human thought. Currently the primary goal of my research is to provide a non-Darwinian scientific explanation of human behavior that can be applied, by anthropologists, to the behavior of living humans. This explanatory model is based solely on a cybernetic perspective of functional biology and excludes adaptive explanations derived from evolutionary biology because the latter, although providing true and useful concepts, are non-empirical and statistical, rather than empirical and causal. Unlike the Darwinian view, the model explains the many human behaviors that make no sense from an evolutionary (adaptational) perspective as well as behaviors that do conform to fitness expectations. It is hoped that the causal model will also help to prevent the growing rift in anthropology between cultural anthropologists and physical anthropologists."

After graduating, he taught at the University of Pennsylvania in the School of Arts and Sciences, in the Wharton School of Business, as well as at Temple University in the Department of Anthropology. My research investigates the process by which time, typically considered universal and homogenous, is recast as lived, social time—inherently particular and invested with local meanings. The research examines Yucatec Maya speakers in the village of Betania, Quintana Roo, México. Using a combination of historical analysis, participant observation, and structured and unstructured interviews, as well as grammatical and discursive investigations of genres of Yucatec Maya writing and speech, my Ph.D. thesis traced the development of current Betanian temporal metaculture. Through an analysis of the Conquest of México and the major contemporary religious and politico-economic structures of temporality, as well as the competing discourses surrounding the Daylight Saving Time debate, the thesis shows that time is always constructed out of relationships that index and are indexed by specific socio-historical constellations. Thus time is inherently semiotic, and particularly deictic. The thesis concluded by arguing that the significance of this research for anthropology lies in a deeper appreciation of the semiotic constraints on temporality, while the importance to philosophical inquiry is in sketching an ethnographically nuanced indexical relation between Being and Time. My current research is grounded in my recent fieldwork and has two distinct components. My first area of interest is examining the role of lived social time in constructing Yucatec identities outside of the village environment. Returning to Mérida, with the support of the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán and others, I would like to examine temporal metaculture in an urban environment. Related to this, I also plan to carry out similar research in diasporic Yucatecan communities in the USA. My second area of interest is to develop and publish a theoretical understanding of pitch and accent in Yucatec Maya."

  bio: "I have a B.A. in Political Science and Economics from Rutgers University and an M.A. in International Relations from Yale University. I received my Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Chicago in December 2010. In 2011-2012, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University’s Harriman Institute. My research interests include nationalism and xenophobia, language ideologies, transnational governance, migration, and youth. My dissertation research was based on 16 months of fieldwork with non-profit organizations focused on young people. In my dissertation, Projecting Europe: the Politics of Youth in Contemporary Lithuania, I argue that an important way in which the European Union is experienced and interpreted in local contexts is through \"project work,\" a novel form of social action and transnational governance. I focus on one particular type of project work—initiatives that target \"at-risk\" youth and aim to make these individuals into European citizens—and show how EU objectives are reinterpreted by non-profit directors, social workers, activists, and young people. Instead of creating liberal European subjects, youth-focused projects contribute to perpetuation of uneven social opportunities, existent language ideologies, and multi-tier citizenship. At the same time, participation in multiple projects creates transnational networks of people who share social resources and learn modes of action and communication from each other. I use these findings to conceptualize emerging modes of governance in the EU and analyze local effects of practices targeting young people. In 2011-2012, as one of the coordinators of Harriman Institute's core project, \"Peoples in Motion,\" I conducted research on Lithuanian labor migrants to the UK. I conducted interviews with Lithuanian migrants living in London in order to examine the interplay of transnational mobility, socio-economic inequality, and cultural ideas about ethnic difference. My next research project will focus on international sporting events in the Russian Federation in order to examine the intersection of political economy, nationalism, and migration. My teaching interests include globalization, linguistic anthropology, political anthropology, youth, popular culture, and urban anthropology, as well as anthropology of the EU and post-Soviet politics and societies."

  bio: "My scholarship focuses on the field of skeletal biology. My work explores human biological variation in both contemporary and archaeological populations. By graduate training, I am a bioarchaeologist, and I ask questions about ancient human biology by excavating and analyzing archaeological human skeletal remains. By post-doctoral training, I am a genetic epidemiologist, specializing in questions surrounding environmental and genetic contributions to human skeletal growth and development and disease status. The common principles of bone biology between living and past populations unite my research from disparate time periods and geographical locations. Direct observation of growth and development in living populations allows me to explore avenues that influence human biology (beyond growth and development this also includes health and disease status) which cannot be explored using the skeletal remains from past peoples. These observations include longitudinal assessment of growth and development, some cultural practices that influence growth and disease, and the genetics behind normal skeletal development and skeletal dysmorphology. Similarly, my work with archaeological populations expands knowledge about ancient human biology and human variation in the past. By conducting research in both contemporary and archaeological populations, I hope to demonstrate the commonalities/dissimilarities between the past and the present and develop a comprehensive view of aspects of skeletal biology that cannot be explored in only living or only past populations."
