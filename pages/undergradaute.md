Our bachelor’s degree in global studies is an interdisciplinary program that invites students to learn from a wide array of knowledge and methods in order to be better prepared for a global world. The curriculum offers a foundation through a set of four introductory courses, as well as specialization in one of three tracks: global security, global economy and global cultures. The tracks allow the students to identify a specialized program of study that draws from a structured set of requirements and electives, culminating in a research-based and writing-intensive capstone seminar.

## Our Fastest Growing Program

The Global Studies program is an interdisciplinary program that challenges ambitious and engaged students to study the world from different perspectives with faculty from a dozen departments.

Through our regional enrichment program and study abroad option, students have the opportunity to study abroad at Temple’s campuses in Rome and Japan and at dozens of  other Temple-recognized programs. While abroad, students can earn credit toward the major for completing global internships, giving them valuable career experience.

## Linking Language with The Liberal Arts

The Global Studies major and minor link together social science and humanities courses with the advanced study of a foreign language.
