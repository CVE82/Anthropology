## Peerless Personal Attention

Our students receive personal attention from our high-quality faculty. The small average size of our upper-level classes permits our faculty to work closely with students, meeting their educational needs and preparing them for whatever career path they seek after graduation.

Students have the opportunity to collaborate with faculty on field research in locations around the world, from biologi-cal research in Oman, to socio-cultural research in India, to archeological research right here in the Delaware Valley.

Undergraduate majors in anthropology pursue one of three courses of study: **General Anthropology**, the **Human Biology track**, or the **Anthropology of Visual Communication track**. Laboratory facilities, internships, fieldwork and experiential learning courses provide students with practical experiences in all of anthropologyâ€™s subdisciplines. A minor is also available in General Anthropology and in Anthropology of Visual Communication.
