Anthropology is the study of human origins, development, activities and experiences throughout time and around the world. At Temple, students take courses in all four subfields of anthropology (archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology and sociocultural anthropology) in order to develop an understanding of human origins, development, activities and experiences throughout time and around the world. With its focus on understanding human diversity, and a commitment to developing critical analysis, problem solving, communication and technological literacy skills, the general anthropology major prepares students for work in local, state and federal-level government agencies, in international development, in social services, in medicine and health-related fields, in education (primary, secondary and higher), in city planning, in cultural resources management, in environmental policy, and in the media.

## Understand The Diverse World We Live In

Studying anthropology at Temple helps build the creative thinking and critical analysis needed to solve complex  problems in today’s world. We teach cross cultural  understanding, interdisciplinary connection and  computational and analytical skills.  With our training you’ll be able to connect on a deeper level with people from many linguistic and geographical backgrounds, and generate key insights into how people make sense and meaning in their worlds.

## Peerless Personal Attention

Our students receive personal attention from our  
high-quality faculty. The small average size of our upper-level classes permits our faculty to work closely with students, meeting their educational needs and preparing them for whatever career path they seek after graduation.

Students have the opportunity to collaborate with faculty on field research in locations around the world, from biologi-cal research in Oman, to socio-cultural research in India, to archeological research right here in the Delaware Valley.

## We Have a Lab For That

We offer a multitude of experiential learning opportunities and facilities right here on campus for you to immerse   yourself in anthropology. Facilities include:
- Anthropology Laboratory and Museum
- Media Anthropology Laboratory
- Linguistic Anthropology Teaching Laboratory
- Physical Anthropology Teaching Laboratory

## Academic offerings

 - BA in General Anthropology
 - BA in Human Biology
 - BA in Anthropology and Visual Communication
 - Minor in General Anthropology
 - Minor in Anthropology of Visual Communication
 - PhD in Anthropology (Concentrations: Archeology, Biological Anthropology, Linguistic Anthropology)

# What is anthropology?

Anthropology is the study, from multiple perspectives, of humanity's origins, development, activities, and experiences, throughout time and throughout the world. Drawing on a wide range of theoretical and methodological approaches, anthropologists seek answers to such questions as: What does it mean to be human? How have humans developed over the course of time? What human universals can be identified, and what is the range of human diversity, both physical and cultural? How do people interact with their physical and social environments? How and to what extent does being a speaker of a particular language or languages affect the ways in which one perceives and experiences the world? How do historical, social, cultural, politico-economic, and ecological factors shape the lives of particular groups of people, and of particular individuals within those groups?

Anthropology comprises four subdisciplines, all of which are well represented at Temple:

- [archaeology](http://www.cla.temple.edu/anthro/archaeology/index.html)
- [biological anthropology](http://www.cla.temple.edu/anthro/biological/index.html)
- [linguistic anthropology](http://www.cla.temple.edu/anthro/linguistic/index.html)
- [sociocultural anthropology](http://www.cla.temple.edu/anthro/sociocultural/index.html).

We also offer specialized courses and training in [anthropology of visual communication](http://www.cla.temple.edu/anthro/visual/index.html) (which draws primarily on linguistic anthropology and sociocultural anthropology).

## Archaeology
Archaeologists study people and cultures of the past by analyzing material remains such as artifacts, human remains, architecture, landscapes, and environments. Archeaologists use this evidence to study such topics as the formation of social groups, ideologies, subsistence patterns, human interactions with the environment.

Some areas of focus:
-Historical archaeology: the study of historically documented cultures. Faculty and students focus on battlefield and urban archaeology in the northeastern states.
-Bioarchaeology: the study of human remains. Faculty and students study activity patterns, health, growth and development of past populations.
-Prehistoric archaeology: the study of the past before historic records began. Faculty and students study the peopling of the Americas.

Some key questions:
-How did subsistence patterns of hunting and gathering shift to agriculture over the course of a few millennia?
-Why did cities emerge, apparently quite independently in different parts of the world?
-How are identities formed, both of individuals and of groups?

## Biological Anthropology
Biological anthropologists study the evolutionary origins of all humans, and the variation that exists among contemporary populations, as well as how biological variation existed in past populations. They consider how the environment, genes, and culture interact to shape human biology in the past and present.

Some key areas of focus:

- Faculty and students study the ways in which humans have adapted to extreme environments, such as high altitude.
- Faculty and students study the genetic basis and evolutionary origins of human diseases.
- Faculty and students study the role of nutrition in shaping growth and development, and human health over the life course.

Some key questions:

- What were our ancestors like?
- What are the biological bases of uniquely human traits, as they compare to living and extinct primates?
- How can we explain physical variation among human populations?

### Linguistic Anthropology
Linguistic anthropologists study the dynamic relationships among speakers, language, culture, and society. This subfield explores the many ways in which communicative practices shape patterns of social interaction, categories of identity and group membership, cultural beliefs and ideologies, and the cultural resources to engage natural and social worlds.

Some areas of focus:

- Language socialization: The study of how a speaker learns a language while simultaneously learning to become competent members of a cultural community.
- Language contact: The study of the historical, political, and sociocultural dynamics of two or more languages in contact.
- Language ideology: The study of the socially constructed, "commonsense" notions about languages, their speakers, and communicative norms.

Some key questions:

- What are the dynamic relationships among language, culture, and society?
- How do children and other novices develop the fluency to use languages in socially intelligible and culturally appropriate ways?
- What does it mean when we lose the last speaker of a language, and what factors lead to these situations?

### Sociocultural Anthropology
Sociocultural anthropologists study social patterns and practices, paying close attention to how people around the world live, organize, govern, and create meaning about themselves and others.
To gain a firsthand sense of a community, sociocultural anthropologists spend time living in a community to do fieldwork which emphasizes the methodology of participant observation.

Some areas of focus:

- Political anthropology: The study of patterns of governance, politics, and power. Faculty and students study legal systems and violence in the Caribbean.
- Media anthropology: The study of media consumption and production. Faculty and students study national, transnational, and regional discourses in European mass media.
- Faculty and students study lucha libre (professional wrestling) and its place in urban popular culture in Mexico City.

Some key questions:

- How do macro-level processes impact everyday lived experiences?
- Are there human "cultural universals" and do they change over time?
- How is globalization changing the way people understand themselves and others?

### Anthropology of Visual Communication
Temple University's Department of Anthropology has long been known, both nationally and internationally, for its specialization in the anthropology of visual communication. Specialized courses and training were first established by Professor Jay Ruby (now retired) in the late 1960s and developed over a period of more than three decades. We continue to offer this specialization to undergraduate majors and minors in anthropology (through our undergraduate Anthropology of Visual Communication track) as well as to doctoral students.

The anthropology of visual communication is broadly concerned with the production, distribution, reception, circulation, and transformation of visual forms, both within and across communities.  Areas of ethnographic and theoretical focus include events such as rituals, spectacles, and performances; works of art, architecture, clothing, and the body; museums, displays, and expositions; and media-based productions such as films, videos, photography, and websites.

Our approach to the anthropology of visual communication has two main objectives: (1) understanding the social, cultural, historical, political, economic, and ideological dimensions of visual communication, in all of its diverse forms; and (2) building technical competency in communicating anthropological knowledge through visual formats such as film, video, photography, curated displays, and digital media.  We are particularly interested in indigenous media, and, as part of our commitment to exploring the ways in which individuals and communities orient themselves within a "globalizing" social universe, we have begun to devote increasing attention to the study of "new media."

The Anthropology of Visual Communication Laboratory, or "Visual Lab," supports teaching and training as well as research projects, particularly student projects.  The Visual Lab has equipment for recording, analyzing, and editing digitally recorded audio-video materials.  The lab’s resources are also used for exploring new ways of making ethnographic documentation and other forms of anthropological knowledge accessible through websites and other interactive productions.

Professors who offer courses and mentoring directly relevant to the anthropology of visual communication include Inmaculada García Sánchez, Paul Garrett, Jayasinhji Jhala, and Damien Stankiewicz.  Strongly relevant courses in sociocultural anthropology are offered by Mindie Lazarus-Black and others; and we encourage students to explore ways of drawing on the department's course offerings in archaeology and biological anthropology as well.

Outside of the Department of Anthropology, several other Temple faculty members have relevant research and teaching interests and are supportive of cross-disciplinary work.  They include Warren Bass, Roderick Coover, and Paul Swann (Department of Film and Media Arts), Kimmika Williams-Witherspoon (Theater), Kariamu Welsh (Dance), Miles Orvell (English), and Gerald Silk (Art History).  Potentially relevant courses can be found in various colleges, departments, and programs at Temple, such as Film and Media Arts, Photography, Theater, Dance, Art History, Journalism, and Geography and Urban Studies.

Beyond their course work, our students have carried out independent field research projects in the USA, South America, Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, and New Zealand.  Each year, several students, both undergraduate and graduate, participate in Professor Jhala's [Temple University Summer Program in India](http://www.temple.edu/studyabroad/programs/summer/india/index.html), which provides extraordinary opportunities for fieldwork and independent projects.

Training in the anthropology of visual communication is potentially applicable to a variety of careers, including university-based teaching and research as well as jobs in museums and other educational institutions, non-profit organizations, government agencies, the arts, tourism, advertising, journalism, and mass media.

Undergraduate majors in anthropology pursue one of three courses of study: [General Anthropology](http://www.cla.temple.edu/anthro/undergraduate/general/index.html), the [Human Biology track](http://www.cla.temple.edu/anthro/undergraduate/bio/index.html), or the [Anthropology of Visual Communication track](http://www.cla.temple.edu/anthro/undergraduate/visual/index.html). Laboratory facilities, internships, fieldwork and experiential learning courses provide students with practical experiences in all of anthropology’s subdisciplines. A minor is also available in General Anthropology and in Anthropology of Visual Communication.

## General Anthropology

The General Anthropology major and minor are intended to give students a strong foundation in all four subdisciplines of anthropology. Each subdiscipline requires the development of broadly applicable skills, including formulating hypotheses, developing research programs and proposals, applying theories to the interpretation of data, and gathering ethnographic information through participant observation.  There is sufficient flexibility in the requirements for the General Anthropology major and minor that students can focus their coursework, if they desire, on one of the four subdisciplines in particular.

With their emphasis on understanding human diversity, the General Anthropology major and minor prepare students well for the issues that they are likely to encounter in today's workplaces. At Temple, we offer a variety of courses that prepare students for careers in such fields as teaching, public administration, social work, urban planning, journalism, mass media, business, and law. Our courses in archaeology train students well for careers in cultural resources management and historic preservation. The major or minor in anthropology is excellent preparation for careers and activities that call for cultural sensitivity and understanding of cultural differences, such as the teaching of English to speakers of other languages, work with immigrant communities, and work with international non-profit and non-governmental organizations.

## Human Biology Track

The Human Biology track prepares students for careers in medicine, dentistry, physical therapy, optometry, podiatry, and other allied health fields. Students preparing for these fields sometimes find the traditional science majors too restrictive. Human Biology students major in anthropology, but take departmental courses primarily in biological anthropology. The Human Biology track also includes required courses in biology and human anatomy and physiology. The track provides several options for completing other science courses that fulfill admission requirements to professional schools in the health sciences. This program, like those at Stanford, the University of Michigan, and Harvard, also encourages students to take health/biology-related courses in psychology, sociology, history, political science, and the humanities. As a result, our students have the broad liberal arts background that many professional schools in the health sciences find attractive.

## Anthropology of Visual Communication Track

The Anthropology of Visual Communication track emphasizes a well-rounded liberal arts background and a comprehensive understanding of the world’s varied systems of visual representation and communication. The Anthropology of Visual Communication curriculum allows students to apply the approaches and perspectives of linguistic anthropology and sociocultural anthropology (and potentially, other areas of study) toward the study and practice of visual communication. The courses in this track draw on the social sciences, the humanities, and the media arts.

The Anthropology of Visual Communication track is well suited to those with interests in popular culture, the fine arts, documentary and ethnographic film, feature film, all forms of artistic performance, televisual communication (including both broadcast and narrowcast forms), home media, and alternative media. Increasing attention is now being given to "new media" and their role in "globalization" processes.  

Students may do original research that involves still photography and/or video production, making use of ethnographic field methods to achieve understanding of both the processes and the products of visual communication. Laboratories are available for both still photography and video production. Each year, some students participate in the [Temple University Summer Program in India](http://www.temple.edu/studyabroad/programs/summer/india/index.html), led by Professor Jhala, which investigates Indian civilization through anthropological and historical approaches to its religious and artistic traditions, both ancient and contemporary.
