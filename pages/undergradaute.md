Anthropology is the study of human origins, development, activities and experiences throughout time and around the world. At Temple, students take courses in all four subfields of anthropology (archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology and sociocultural anthropology) in order to develop an understanding of human origins, development, activities and experiences throughout time and around the world. With its focus on understanding human diversity, and a commitment to developing critical analysis, problem solving, communication and technological literacy skills, the general anthropology major prepares students for work in local, state and federal-level government agencies, in international development, in social services, in medicine and health-related fields, in education (primary, secondary and higher), in city planning, in cultural resources management, in environmental policy, and in the media.

## Understand The Diverse World We Live In

Studying anthropology at Temple helps build the creative thinking and critical analysis needed to solve complex  problems in today’s world. We teach cross cultural  understanding, interdisciplinary connection and  computational and analytical skills.  With our training you’ll be able to connect on a deeper level with people from many linguistic and geographical backgrounds, and generate key insights into how people make sense and meaning in their worlds.

## Peerless Personal Attention

Our students receive personal attention from our  
high-quality faculty. The small average size of our upper-level classes permits our faculty to work closely with students, meeting their educational needs and preparing them for whatever career path they seek after graduation.
