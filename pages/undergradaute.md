Undergraduate majors in anthropology pursue one of three courses of study: **General Anthropology**, the **Human Biology track** or the **Anthropology of Visual Communication track**. Laboratory facilities, internships, fieldwork and experiential learning courses provide students with practical experience in all of anthropologyâ€™s subdisciplines. A minor is also available in General Anthropology and in Anthropology of Visual Communication.

You will have the opportunity to collaborate with faculty on field research in locations around the world, from biological research in Oman, to sociocultural research in India, to archeological research right here in the Delaware Valley.
