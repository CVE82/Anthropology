Anthropology is the study of human origins, development, activities and experiences throughout time and around the world. At Temple, students take courses in all four subfields of anthropology (archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology and sociocultural anthropology) in order to develop an understanding of human origins, development, activities and experiences throughout time and around the world. With its focus on understanding human diversity, and a commitment to developing critical analysis, problem solving, communication and technological literacy skills, the general anthropology major prepares students for work in local, state and federal-level government agencies, in international development, in social services, in medicine and health-related fields, in education (primary, secondary and higher), in city planning, in cultural resources management, in environmental policy, and in the media.

## Understand The Diverse World We Live In

Studying anthropology at Temple helps build the creative thinking and critical analysis needed to solve complex  problems in today’s world. We teach cross cultural  understanding, interdisciplinary connection and  computational and analytical skills.  With our training you’ll be able to connect on a deeper level with people from many linguistic and geographical backgrounds, and generate key insights into how people make sense and meaning in their worlds.

## Peerless Personal Attention

Our students receive personal attention from our  
high-quality faculty. The small average size of our upper-level classes permits our faculty to work closely with students, meeting their educational needs and preparing them for whatever career path they seek after graduation.

Students have the opportunity to collaborate with faculty on field research in locations around the world, from biologi-cal research in Oman, to socio-cultural research in India, to archeological research right here in the Delaware Valley.

## We Have a Lab For That

We offer a multitude of experiential learning opportunities and facilities right here on campus for you to immerse   yourself in anthropology. Facilities include:
- Anthropology Laboratory and Museum
- Media Anthropology Laboratory
- Linguistic Anthropology Teaching Laboratory
- Physical Anthropology Teaching Laboratory

## Academic offerings

 - BA in General Anthropology
 - BA in Human Biology
 - BA in Anthropology and Visual Communication
 - Minor in General Anthropology
 - Minor in Anthropology of Visual Communication
 - PhD in Anthropology (Concentrations: Archeology, Biological Anthropology, Linguistic Anthropology)
 
 What is anthropology?

Anthropology is the study, from multiple perspectives, of humanity's origins, development, activities, and experiences, throughout time and throughout the world. Drawing on a wide range of theoretical and methodological approaches, anthropologists seek answers to such questions as: What does it mean to be human? How have humans developed over the course of time? What human universals can be identified, and what is the range of human diversity, both physical and cultural? How do people interact with their physical and social environments? How and to what extent does being a speaker of a particular language or languages affect the ways in which one perceives and experiences the world? How do historical, social, cultural, politico-economic, and ecological factors shape the lives of particular groups of people, and of particular individuals within those groups? 

Anthropology comprises four subdisciplines, all of which are well represented at Temple: archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and sociocultural anthropology. We also offer specialized courses and training in anthropology of visual communication (which draws primarily on linguistic anthropology and sociocultural anthropology). 

Undergraduate majors in anthropology pursue one of three courses of study: General Anthropology, the Human Biology track, or the Anthropology of Visual Communication track. Laboratory facilities, internships, fieldwork and experiential learning courses provide students with practical experiences in all of anthropology’s subdisciplines. A minor is also available in General Anthropology and in Anthropology of Visual Communication.
