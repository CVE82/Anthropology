Students who are interested in the General Anthropology major or minor, the Human Biology track, or the Anthropology of Visual Communication track should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Prof. Inmaculada García Sánchez, at [igarcias@temple.edu](mailto:igarcias@temple.edu).
 
## Undergraduate Anthropology Association (UAA) 

The Undergraduate Anthropology Association is a forum in which anthropology majors and minors can meet one another as well as interact with professors and graduate students. We include all areas of anthropological study: archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, sociocultural anthropology, and anthropology of visual communication. 

We hold bi-monthly meetings where professors discuss their areas of specialization and we organize trips to museums and events, a graduate student panel, fundraisers, ethnic food nights, and other fun events! It's a great organization to become involved in, especially if you seek guidance in continuing your studies in anthropology at the graduate level.

Meetings of the Undergraduate Anthropology Association (UAA) are generally held every other Wednesday at 5:00 in the Fishbowl (Gladfelter Hall room 212). For further information, contact the association's president, Kelly Steckler, [ksteck44@temple.edu](mailto:ksteck44@temple.edu), or the vice-president, Jordan Galczynski, [jordan.galczynski@temple.edu](mailto:jordan.galczynski@temple.edu); or you can contact us at the association's email address, [templeuaa@gmail.com](mailto:templeuaa@gmail.com).
