In our highly selective PhD program, students develop an original doctoral research project that involves substantial field-based or laboratory-based research to make a significant contribution to the discipline of anthropology. We offer four sub-disciplines of study: archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology and sociocultural anthropology. Doctoral students specialize in one of these areas. We are committed to producing doctorates in anthropology who are well prepared for professional careers in academia, government, non-profit/non-governmental organizations or the private sector.

## Academic offerings

 - [PhD in Anthropology](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/anthropology-phd/) (Concentrations: Archeology, Biological Anthropology, Linguistic Anthropology)
 - Specialized Courses and Training in the [Anthropology of Visual Communication](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/anthropology-phd/#text)

## Archaeology

Archaeologists study people and cultures of the past by analyzing material remains such as artifacts, human remains, architecture, landscapes, and environments. Archeaologists use this evidence to study such topics as the formation of social groups, ideologies, subsistence patterns, human interactions with the environment.

**Some areas of focus:**

- _Historical archaeology_: the study of historically documented cultures. Faculty and students focus on battlefield and urban archaeology in the northeastern states.
- _Bioarchaeology_: the study of human remains. Faculty and students study activity patterns, health, growth and development of past populations.
- _Prehistoric archaeology_: the study of the past before historic records began. Faculty and students study the peopling of the Americas.

## Biological Anthropology

Biological anthropologists study the evolutionary origins of all humans, and the variation that exists among contemporary populations, as well as how biological variation existed in past populations. They consider how the environment, genes, and culture interact to shape human biology in the past and present.

**Some areas of focus:**

- Faculty and students study the ways in which humans have adapted to extreme environments, such as high altitude.
- Faculty and students study the genetic basis and evolutionary origins of human diseases.
- Faculty and students study the role of nutrition in shaping growth and development, and human health over the life course.

### Linguistic Anthropology
Linguistic anthropologists study the dynamic relationships among speakers, language, culture, and society. This subfield explores the many ways in which communicative practices shape patterns of social interaction, categories of identity and group membership, cultural beliefs and ideologies, and the cultural resources to engage natural and social worlds.

**Some areas of focus:**

- **Language Socialization:** The study of how a speaker learns a language while simultaneously learning to become competent members of a cultural community.
- **Language Contact:** The study of the historical, political, and sociocultural dynamics of two or more languages in contact.
- **Language Ideology:** The study of the socially constructed, "commonsense" notions about languages, their speakers, and communicative norms.

## Sociocultural Anthropology

**Some areas of focus:**

- **Political Anthropology:** The study of patterns of governance, politics, and power. Faculty and students study legal systems and violence in the Caribbean.
- **Media Anthropology:** The study of media consumption and production. Faculty and students study national, transnational, and regional discourses in European mass media.
- Faculty and students study lucha libre (professional wrestling) and its place in urban popular culture in Mexico City.

## Anthropology of Visual Communication Track

The Anthropology of Visual Communication track emphasizes a well-rounded liberal arts background and a comprehensive understanding of the worldâ€™s varied systems of visual representation and communication. The Anthropology of Visual Communication curriculum allows students to apply the approaches and perspectives of linguistic anthropology and sociocultural anthropology (and potentially, other areas of study) toward the study and practice of visual communication. The courses in this track draw on the social sciences, the humanities, and the media arts.

The Anthropology of Visual Communication track is well suited to those with interests in popular culture, the fine arts, documentary and ethnographic film, feature film, all forms of artistic performance, televisual communication (including both broadcast and narrowcast forms), home media, and alternative media. Increasing attention is now being given to "new media" and their role in "globalization" processes. 

Students may do original research that involves still photography and/or video production, making use of ethnographic field methods to achieve understanding of both the processes and the products of visual communication. Laboratories are available for both still photography and video production. Each year, some students participate in the [Temple University Summer Program in India](http://www.temple.edu/studyabroad/programs/summer/india/index.html), led by Professor Jhala, which investigates Indian civilization through anthropological and historical approaches to its religious and artistic traditions, both ancient and contemporary.

Sociocultural anthropologists study social patterns and practices, paying close attention to how people around the world live, organize, govern, and create meaning about themselves and others. To gain a firsthand sense of a community, sociocultural anthropologists spend time living in a community to do fieldwork which emphasizes the methodology of participant observation.
