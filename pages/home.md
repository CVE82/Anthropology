Anthropology is the study of humanity’s origins, development, activities and experiences — around the world and throughout time. Anthropology comprises four sub-disciplines, all of which are well-represented at Temple: archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and sociocultural anthropology. We also offer specialized courses and training in Anthropology of Visual Communication, which draws primarily on linguistic anthropology and sociocultural anthropology, and Human Biology, which offers students interested in health care a unique perspective on the genomic, environmental and behavioral basis of human variability.
